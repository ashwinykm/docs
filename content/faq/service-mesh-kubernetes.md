## Question

Do you recommend utilizing a service mesh for Kubernetes?


## Answer

We do not have the experience to date. We need and want to establish best practices for it. We also don't know the full ramifications or impact of using Istio or Envoy with off-the-shelf services. If this is a requirement, we should do a PoC early to determine impact.
