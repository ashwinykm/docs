## Question

Do you have experience deploying and managing HashiCorp Vault?

## Answer

To date, we haven't used HashiCorp Vault in a production setting, because automatic unsealing was non-trivial. Additionally, a full reboot of the Vault tier would lead to a forced outage of everything, unless a human operator is able to unseal the Vault.

However, at HashiConf 2018, it was announced that this enterprise feature was coming to the community edition. Weâ€™re definitely  open to supporting it once that happens.
