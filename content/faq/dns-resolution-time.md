## Question

How fast is the DNS resolution time when handled by `external-dns`? Do you just set low TTLs?

## Answer

The `external-dns` controller picks up the new DNS entries almost immediately and registers them with Route 53. On the flip side, the zone's `SOA` record acts like the equivalent of a DNS 404 page. We set the SOA TTL to something really short like 30 or 60 seconds to ensure negative caching wonâ€™t cause problems. This happens if someone tries to view the URL before the DNS was created. There's roughly a 20-30 second period where that might be the case, but in practice we never see it. That's because the `helm` deployment waits for all health checks to pass before completing, which is always longer than the time necessary for the DNS controller to pick up and register the DNS entries.
